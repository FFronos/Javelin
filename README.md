# Javelin
High-flow toolhead for 3D Printers at a modest cost.

**Note that this is both unfinished and has not yet been tested. Use the design at your own risk.**

# What is this?

Javelin is a toolhead based on Causality Manufacturing's Vesuvius Lite Hotend. *(Unreleased as of December 24th, 2025)*
More information about Vesuvius Lite can be found on their website https://www.causalitymfg.com/
Javelin is intended to be a structurally rigid, slim high-flow rate capable toolhead that can be dropped in to most MGN12H X-Rail based setups.
Current weight estimate for when its fully complete is around ~400g.

# Components

## Hotend
The hotend is the unreleased Vesuvius Lite designed and to be manufactured by Causality Manufacturing. 
The hotend is effectively the centerpiece of Javelin as its bent sheet metal shroud serves as a direct hotend mount to the MGN12H block, as well as mounting points for the ducts, belt fastening solutions, extruder, and any additional peripherals one may add.
The heatbreak is air cooled by a 2510 fan. Nozzle compatibility includes standard V6 style nozzles.

## Extruder
I've opted for an Orbiter 2.5 *(The Orbiter 2 is also compatible)* due to its lightweight housing and great overall properties. Truthfully basically any extruder works, but i tend to *gravitate* toward the orbiters. You can also add the orbiter smart sensor onto it if you prefer. You will need to modify the duct if you plan on using a different extruder, as it uses standoffs behind the motor as a mounting point. You will need a pancake stepper motor.

## Belt mounting
This is partly unfinished.
So far, a clamp mount for Monolith Gantry 9/10mm belts is developed, however the screw cap profiles will be remade to be dovetails soon.
Options for 6mm monolith and 6mm/9mm stock voron will be developed soonTM

## Duct
I haven't gotten to this yet.
Single CPAP tube, passes under the X beam to fork into dual channels blowing at the nozzle at the end. The electronics will also mount here, plus a beacon mount (Other probe mounts will be made in the future, such as standard inductive ones.)
